# ACM-ICPC Algorithms

### Introduction to ACM ICPC
For starters: ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. 

For nerds: Elaborately, we can say that the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. 
- Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. 
- Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. 
- Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. 

### Then what is the purpose of ACM-ICPC Algorithms ?
ACM-ICPC Algorithms is your personal offline collection of every algorithm and data structure used to solve the questions of this worldwide recognized Olympiad. It aims at providing solutions in a various languages,as per [ICPC 2018 WF](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment), including 
-  C 
-  C++
-  Java
-  Python (2 & 3)
-  Kotlin.

If you know algorithms and don't know particular language, this is effort to help you understand ICPC algorithms in favorite language.
