# Jump Search
Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays.The idea behind this is to check fewer elements(than linear search) by jumping ahead a fixed amount of steps instead of searching all elements.

## Example
For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) size m. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.

Let’s consider the following array: (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610). Length of the array is 16. Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assuming that the block size to be jumped is 4.
STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4;
STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8;
STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 16;
STEP 4: Since the element at index 16 is greater than 55 we will jump back a step to come to index 9.
STEP 5: Perform linear search from index 9 to get the element 55.
