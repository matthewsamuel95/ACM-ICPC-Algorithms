# Diophantine Equations

A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integral solutions are required. An Integral solution is a solution such that all the unknown variables take only integer values.

Given three integers a, b, c representing a linear equation of the form : `ax + by = c`. Determine if the equation has a solution such that x and y are both integral values.
